GitHub... While it a pretty cool tool for version control. It can do a fair bit more then just that. Such as collaboration with other, and Even Hosting of static websites to name a few. There is quite a lot more that GitHub is capable of. But on note thats related to the title of this post is... When working in the cli to push code changes I always forget the commands and need to google them. I know given enough times it will eventually stick. But until then I will just be confused as to what the commands are until I refigure them out.
