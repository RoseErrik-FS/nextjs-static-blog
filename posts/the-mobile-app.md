Using React Native to build mobile apps that are cross platform is pretty convenient with it ability to write the code base once and have it work on either both IOS and Android is pretty nice. Although it I keep running into the issue of needing to restart the expo server and client cause they like to crash a lot for me. Or needing to refresh the cache as keeps not actually updating sometimes when I make a change. But thats all small stuff and could just be user error as I have not used React Native Before.

I did have to install Android Studio to even use virtual devices. As I use and Android phone I feel like its just a better idea to use what you know.
