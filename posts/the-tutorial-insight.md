A while back I found a tutorial covering Next.js 13... well it was more then just that as it was creating a clone of a site. The site that was chosen was Spotify. It was using Next.js 13 with react, Tailwind CSS for styling, a PostgreSQL database hosted on Supabase. It even covered using Stripe for payments. I followed along with it all the way up to Stripe. It was a pretty long video almost 7 hours long. It definitely got pretty confusing at times. It covered the creation of an account, uploading of music and even the playing of it. While it looked similar to spotify it wasn't really a clone of spotify as most "clones" that I have seen are usually just frontend that use the spotify api to access spotify. This one was a web app that played music that you uploaded.

as I no longer have the files for it as I deleted them here is a picture of my cat
