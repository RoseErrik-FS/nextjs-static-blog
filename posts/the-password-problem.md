So Lets talk about password hashing for just a small amount of time. I recently seen an article from 2019 which is awhile ago about Facebook storing passwords in plain text. Which to me is crazy that such big companies had done so. While I don't know the inner workings of how their software works. From my recent experience learning about bcrypt it wasn't all that hard to to hash the password so its secure. Now again this is only on the database side. I am assuming that from what I learn so far the what i've done is it still sending the password in plain text over the internet to the API Backend before it gets hashed. I'm sure there are ways to stop that But I haven't really learned that yet.
